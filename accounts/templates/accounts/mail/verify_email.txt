Log in today to access the best available data on ocean science through a state-of-the art data visualization, storytelling, and a networking platform that connects you to agency, industry, and community leaders who are shaping the future of our ocean. Use these quick tips to get started:



MAKE A MAP.

Marine Planner is a powerful data visualization tool that helps you make maps of your own in no time â€“ just select any of the data layers to see how different ocean uses intersect. As a registered user, you can customize, save, share and export your maps.

Take me to Marine Planner [http://midatlantic.point97.io/visualize/#x=-73.24&y=38.93&z=7&logo=true&controls=true&basemap=Ocean&tab=data&legends=false&layers=true] 



COLLABORATE.

Network with your Portal community through map groups.

Invite your colleagues to illustrate ocean uses, find compatibilities, and reduce ocean conflict. The mapping projects you create together can be saved and shared with other group members or other registered Portal users, publicly or privately.

KEEP EXPLORING. 

We'll update the Portal as ocean use data emerges and conflicts and collaborations surface.
